### About me

I am a data enthusiast with a strong background in psychology and data analytics. I hold a Bachelor's in Psychology, a Master's in Psychological Evaluation, and a specialization in Data Analytics for Social Sciences. I teach statistics at the University of Buenos Aires' Psychology Department and contribute to a research team studying the efficacy of psychological interventions. Throughout my research career, I’ve often been the go-to person for data analysis, which has fueled my passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights.

I am currently a forum moderator for the Google Data Analytics courses on Coursera, where I assist students in their analytics journey. I am eager to join a team of experienced professionals to continue learning and expanding my expertise in data analytics.

Beyond work, I enjoy acroyoga, contemporary dance, and playing board games with friends. For me, answering questions through data feels like solving a captivating board game mystery—unraveling clues and discovering meaningful solutions.
