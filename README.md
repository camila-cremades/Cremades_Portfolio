### <span style="color: DarkMagenta;">About me</span>

<img src="FotoCami.jpg" width="20%" />

I am a data enthusiast with a strong background in psychology and data analytics. I hold a Bachelor's in Psychology, a Master's in Psychological Evaluation, and a specialization in Data Analytics for Social Sciences. I teach statistics at the University of Buenos Aires' Psychology Department and contribute to a research team studying the efficacy of psychological interventions. Throughout my research career, I’ve often been the go-to person for data analysis, which has fueled my passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights.

I am currently a forum moderator for the Google Data Analytics courses on Coursera, where I assist students in their analytics journey. I am eager to join a team of experienced professionals to continue learning and expanding my expertise in data analytics.

Beyond work, I enjoy acroyoga, contemporary dance, and playing board games with friends. For me, answering questions through data feels like solving a captivating board game mystery, unraveling clues and discovering meaningful solutions.

### <span style="color: DarkMagenta;">Case Studies</span>

#### [Cluster analysis to determine bill authenticity](https://camila-cremades.github.io/Case-Studies/Cluster_Analysis.html)

The banknote dataset, included in the R package mclust, contains six measurements taken on 100 genuine and 100 counterfeit Swiss 1000-franc bills.
This study aimed to determine whether a clustering method based on the characteristics of the bills could identify their authenticity.

#### [Evaluation of the Effects of Practices and School Type on Exam Scores](https://camila-cremades.github.io/Case-Studies/Lineal_Regresion_2.html)

The GCSE exam scores dataset from the mlmRev package was used. The objective of this assignment was to evaluate the effects of the different variables in the dataset on an exam score.

#### [Mediation and moderation of psychological variables](https://camila-cremades.github.io/Case-Studies/Mediation_Moderation.html)

Three activities are presented. The efc dataset from the sjPlot package was used to explore whether there is a moderating effect of disability severity on caregiving hours to predict negative affect.
On the other hand, the dataset affect from the package psyckTools was used to test a mediation model to analyze whether the effect of negative-affect-oriented movies (IV; “peliculas_em_n”) on negative affect (DV; NA2) after watching the movie is explained by the perceived tension in the subjects (M; “TA2”). The same dataset was used to fit a mediation model to analyze whether levels of negative affect mediate the effect of neuroticism on depression.

#### [Regresion Analysis to predict cigarette sales in the USA](https://camila-cremades.github.io/Case-Studies/Lineal_Regresion.html)

A dataset including socioeconomic, demographic variables and cigarette sales in the 50 states of USA was used.
This study used a regression equation that relates per-capita cigarette consumption across the state (variable Sales) to various socioeconomic and demographic variables to determine whether these variables are useful for predicting cigarette consumption.

#### [Sex prediction from psychological variables using Machine Learning](https://camila-cremades.github.io/Case-Studies/Sex-prediction-from-psychological-variables.html)
